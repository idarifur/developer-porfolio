            <p>None of these stories are mine. They were sent to me by readers of Atomic Habits. My hope is
                that these
                examples will illustrate how real people are putting the book into practice. They will show you what
                people
                are actually doing to build good habits and break bad ones. And hopefully, they will spark some ideas
                for
                how you can do the same.</p>
